**Description of the problem:**

This project analyzed crime data provided by Toronto Police Service and provided insights of each neighbourhood in Toronto. Topics included which neighbourhood are the most safeties/dangerous to live in Toronto; which time periods have the most crime rates; changes in number of crimes through 2014 to 2018; changes in crime types through 2014 to 2017; how long was the crime reported after it was occurred; correlations between different types of crimes 

**Data source:** 

The data used in this project is downloaded from Toronto Police Service - Public Safety Data Portal. The data are from 2014 to 2017, and are categorized as Neighbourhood Crime Rate, Robbery, Theft Over, Break and Enter, Homicide, Auto Theft, and Bicycle Theft 

**Technologies:**

The programming language of this project was Python in Jupyter environment with multiple libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, basemap, numpy and pandas

**Visualizations:**

* Histogram graphs were used to show the frequency of a category such as how crimes occurred in different time periods-
* Line graphs were used to plot data through 2014 to 2017, such as number of crimes through 2014 to 2017 
* Bar graphs were used to compare different categories such as types of crimes 
*Stacked bar graphs were used to compare the overall quantities also illustrate the contribution of each category to the totals such as distribution of all crime types in each neighbourhood 
* Heat maps were used to see correlation of each variables such as correlation of all crime types 
* Choropleth maps were used to show the location of crimes and see the number of crimes
