**Description of the problem:**

As urbanization is growing rapidly around the word, there are other concerns raise up as well. One of the main concerns is neighbourhood safety. This project will be analyzing crime data provided by Toronto Police Service and provide insights of each neighbourhood in Toronto. Topics include which neighbourhood are the most safeties/dangerous to live in Toronto; which time periods have the most crime rates; changes in number of crimes through 2014 to 2017; changes in crime types through 2014 to 2017; how long was the crime reported after it was occurred; correlations between different types of crimes 

**Data source:** 

The data used in this project is downloaded from Toronto Police Service - Public Safety Data Portal. The data are from 2014 to 2017, and are categorized as Neighbourhood Crime Rate, Robbery, Theft Over, Break and Enter, Homicide, Auto Theft, and Bicycle Theft 

**Technologies:**

The programming language this project will be using is Python in Jupyter environment with multiple libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, basemap, numpy and pandas

**Visualizations:**

* Histogram graphs will be used to show the frequency of a category such as how crimes occurred in different time periods-
* Line graphs will be used to plot data through 2014 to 2017, such as number of crimes through 2014 to 2017 
* Bar graph will be used to compare different categories such as types of crimes 
*Stacked bar graph will be used to compare the overall quantities also illustrate the contribution of each category to the totals such as distribution of all crime types in each neighbourhood 
* Heat map will be used to see correlation of each variables such as correlation of all crime types 
* Choropleth map will be used to show the location of crimes and see the number of crimes
